# Antes de abrir este arquivo, seja no GitHub Pages ou fazendo a importação via Git Clone / Download ZIP

## É importante saber que:

<p>Este não roda totalmente funcional no GitHub Pages, justamente porque o mesmo faz uma requisição para um servidor local (através do json-server)</p>

<p>É recomendado fazer o download do arquivo utilizando alguns dos métodos do GitHub (<strong>Utilizando o Code >> Clone / GitHub Desktop / Download ZIP</strong>) e após isso abrir em seu editor de código (<strong>Visual Studio Code, SublimeText, etc...</strong>), fazer o npm install no terminal da pasta, para instalar o node_modules e aspós isso também utilizar dos seguintes comandos para rodar o projeto:</p>

##### npm start

## ou

##### yarn start

<p>Para iniciar o projeto, e após isso o seguinte comando para iniciar o servidor (Talvez requerido o json-server: npm install json-server/ yarn add json-server):</p>

##### npm run api

## ou

##### yarn api

<p>Sem os métodos acima não é possível entrar na parte do feed (ultima parte do projeto), muito menos fazer o login na área. Os logins e senhas estão no arquivo 'db.json' na pasta principal</p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [Clone DIO](https://pedrojuri.github.io/clone-dio/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
